# Tribute_page-FFC
The html/css/Js behind my #1 Project from the Responsive Web Design Projects- Tribute Page.  I know it's nothing special but anyway i've decided to save the initially codepen based code on GH.  Please in the attempts of reading the code ignore the total lack of helpfull commenting, again i dont expect this code to be of any use for anyone.  In case you have any questions feel more than free to bother me and ask whatever questions you may have.
 ABOUT THE CODE:
1.The Js file is almost not needed as it contains only an array of quotes and a simple function that displays a random one every 10 seconds.(kind of not the point of the project, but i decided to include it anyway.)
2.The jQuery is 3.2.1 version and is not needed at all, but at the time it seemed the fastest solution.
3.The responsiveness of the page is based on @media query.
